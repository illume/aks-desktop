/**

 * immediately — unless the cluster looks Arc-proxied but was added manually
 * (no plugin metadata) and isn't reachable, in which case it throws a message
 * guiding the user to register it (we can't start its proxy without the Azure
 * subscription/resource group). For registered AKS Hybrid & Edge clusters it
 * makes sure the local `az connectedk8s proxy` is serving the cluster before its
 * views load, so connecting no longer has to be done by hand from the cluster
 * action menu — opening the cluster is enough.
 *
 * It throws (rejecting the returned promise) when the cluster can't be made
 * reachable; Headlamp core surfaces the thrown message with a retry affordance.
 *
 * @param context.cluster - The kubeconfig context / cluster name being opened.
 * @param context.clusterConf - The cluster's config (carries the server URL).
 * @param context.signal - Aborts preparation when the user leaves the cluster.
 * @param context.reportProgress - Reports connection progress to Headlamp.
 * @returns A promise that resolves when the cluster is reachable or needs no setup.
